.SH NAME
.PP
\f[B]gdupload\f[R] - upload local files and folders to Google Drive
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\f[B]gdupload\f[R] [ \f[B]-c\f[R] configdir ] [ \f[B]-m\f[R] maxfiles ] [ \f[B]-u\f[R] ] path/to/fileorfolder [file2 ...]
Where \[aq]path/to/file\[aq] or \[aq]path/to/folder\[aq] are names of a
local file or folder
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]gdupload\f[R] command uploads the specified local files and
folders to Google Drive.
If the argument is a folder then it and its contents are uploaded
recursively.
.PP
In order to avoid the creation of multiple Google Drive folders with the
same name and path, if \f[I]gdupload\f[R] detects an existing Google
Drive folder with the same name as would be uploaded then it prompts the
user to select an option for the upload, offering the following choices:
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]Preserve Existing Folder and Create Sync Folder\[dq]
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]Delete Existing Folder and Upload New\[dq]
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]Create New Duplicate Folder Name\[dq]
.IP \[bu] 2
\[dq]Skip Upload\[dq]
.PP
Files that are synced to google drive with \f[I]sync2drive\f[R] are
tagged with an \f[C]appProperty\f[R] so that the files on Google Drive
can be traversed faster.
This means that you cannot upload files with \f[C]gdrive upload\f[R]
into a sync directory as the files would be missing the sync tag, and
would be ignored by the sync commands.
However, this limitation is overcome (optionally) when the
DriveCommandLine utility \f[C]gdupload\f[R] is used to upload to an
existing sync folder.
