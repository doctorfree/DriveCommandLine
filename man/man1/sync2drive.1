.SH NAME

\f[B]sync2drive\f[R] - Sync a Google Drive folder and its contents to
the locally stored folder
.SH SYNOPSIS
.TP
\f[B]sync2drive\f[R] [ \f[B]-k\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-l\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-m\f[R] maxfiles ] [ \f[B]-n\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-s\f[R] ] [ \f[B]-u\f[R] ] folder|path/to/folder
Where \[aq]folder\[aq] or \[aq]path/to/folder\[aq] is the name of a
Google Drive folder
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]sync2drive\f[R] command syncs a Google Drive folder and its
contents to the locally stored folder of the same name/path.
Files and folders stored locally are uploaded to Google Drive if they
differ or are new.
Extraneous files stored on Google Drive in the specified folder and its
subfolders are removed.
.PP
The \f[I]sync2drive\f[R] command creates a DriveCommandLine
\[aq]sync\[aq] folder.
Subsequent changes to this folder and its contents can be sync\[aq]d
back to the local folder using the \f[I]sync_from_drive\f[R] command.
In addition, changes made locally can be synchronized again by reissuing
the \f[I]sync2drive\f[R] command.
.PP
Files that are synced to google drive with \f[I]sync2drive\f[R] are
tagged with an \f[C]appProperty\f[R] so that the files on Google Drive
can be traversed faster.
This means that you cannot upload files with \f[C]gdrive upload\f[R]
into a sync directory as the files would be missing the sync tag, and
would be ignored by the sync commands.
